AttemptID: GUID, created in the game. Used to link replayData to Attempts.
Level: Which level is the player attempting.
StartTime: The time in epoch milisecond format that the player started the attempt in Long format.
isEngineReplay: Bool value in 0 or 1. 1 Denotes it is indeed an Engine Replay (recording the actions the characthers take)
0 denotes that it is a UI replay (recording the actions that are on the UI level, which might not resolve in to legal actions)

ReplayData Table stores individual actions.
ReplayID: Unique ID.
AttemptID: Denotes whatever attempt this replay data is linked to.
